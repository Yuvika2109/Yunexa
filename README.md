## ✨ Features

- **🔐 Advanced Face Authentication**  
  Uses OpenCV-based facial recognition to verify the user's identity before granting access.

- **🎙️ Voice & Text Interaction**  
  Switch seamlessly between microphone-based voice commands and text-based inputs.

- **🗣️ Real-time Speech Recognition**  
  Processes voice commands instantly using the SpeechRecognition library.

- **🤖 NLP-Powered Intelligence**  
  Integrated with **Hugging Face Transformers** for conversational responses, contextual understanding, and knowledge queries.

- **🖥️ System Control**  
  Execute OS-level commands like opening applications, browsing the web, fetching files, and more.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV  
- **Speech Recognition**: SpeechRecognition  
- **Natural Language Processing**: Hugging Face Transformers  
- **Additional Libraries**: NumPy, Pyttsx3, OS, DateTime, etc.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Face Authentication** – Yunexa scans the user's face using OpenCV and compares it with stored facial data.
2. **Input Mode Selection** – Choose between voice commands or text commands.
3. **Speech-to-Text** – SpeechRecognition converts spoken words into text.
4. **NLP Processing** – Hugging Face Transformers analyze the query and generate relevant responses.
5. **System Execution** – Executes tasks like opening programs, searching online, or fetching data.
